        <h1>Fancy (and super-interesting) background</h1>
        <p>This page uses multiple images to create a seamingly random background that's very quick to load.</p>
        <p>The background color is ghostwhite, and the image file is tiled 3 times on itself at different times.<br>
        (I've chosen 97px, 67px and 37px)</p>
