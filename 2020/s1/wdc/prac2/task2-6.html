            <h1>Checkout my borders</h1>
            <p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px redius.</p>
            <p>Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;<br>
            all horizontal rules are now #9FEFE4.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span><br>
            That prevents it from messin with the line height.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>
        <div class="red">This div has a red border</div>
        <div class="blue">This div has a blue border</div>
        <p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>
        <div class="red-rounded-border">This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>
        <div class="blue-rounded-border">This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>
    </body>
