            <h1>This new heading font is much more elegant</h1>
            <p>We've updated the font for hedings to a more elegant one from Google Fonts: Raleway.<br>
            Note that for this not to break previous pages, sans-serif should still be prsent as a fallback.</p>
            <h2>L2 Heading font is also Raleway</h2>
            <p>Similarly, the default font is now Noto Serif from Google Fonts.<br>
            Again for this to not break previous page, serif should still be present as a fallback.</p>
