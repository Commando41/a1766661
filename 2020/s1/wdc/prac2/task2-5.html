            <h1>This page is all about divs!</h1>
            <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
            <p>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".<br>
            This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span> <span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span><br>
            because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <span class="blue"><span class="fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></span></p>
        </div>
        <p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
